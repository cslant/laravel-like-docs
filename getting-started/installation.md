# ðŸ”§ Installation

Please read carefully the instructions below and follow them step by step.

## Install the package

You can **install the package via composer**:

```bash
composer require cslant/laravel-like
```

The package will automatically register its service provider.

## Configuration

:::danger[required]

**_This is a required step. Please don't skip it._**

:::

You can publish all the necessary configuration and migration files by running the following command:

```shell
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="CSlant\LaravelLike\LikeServiceProvider"
```

## Migrate the database

After the configuration file has been published, you can run the migration:

```shell
php artisan migrate
```

The migration will create a `likes` table in your database. This table will store all the likes.

That's it! You have successfully installed the Laravel Like package. ðŸŽ‰

This is the default content of the config file:

```php
return [
    'name' => 'The interactions configuration',

    /*
     * The flag to determine if the interactions table should use UUIDs.
     * If you want to use UUIDs instead of auto-incrementing integers for your interactions table, set this to true.
     */
    'is_uuids' => false,

    /*
     * The table name for interaction records.
     */
    'table_name' => 'likes',

    /*
     * The model class for the interaction table.
     */
    'interaction_model' => 'CSlant\LaravelLike\Models\Like',

    /*
     * The model and foreign key for the user relationship.
     */
    'users' => [
        /*
         * User model class.
         * Use this to set the user model class for the user relationship.
         */
        'model' => 'App\Models\User',

        /*
         * User tables foreign key name.
         * Use this to set the foreign key name for the user relationship.
         */
        'foreign_key' => 'user_id',
    ],
];
