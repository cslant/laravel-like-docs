# ðŸ›  Configuration

Here is the default configuration for Laravel Like package. You can customize the configuration as per your requirements.

## Configuration file

Path: `config/like.php`

```php
return [
    'name' => 'The interactions configuration',

    /*
     * The flag to determine if the interactions table should use UUIDs.
     * If you want to use UUIDs instead of auto-incrementing integers for your interactions table, set this to true.
     */
    'is_uuids' => false,

    /*
     * The table name for interaction records.
     */
    'table_name' => 'likes',

    /*
     * The model class for the interaction table.
     */
    'interaction_model' => 'CSlant\LaravelLike\Models\Like',

    /*
     * The model and foreign key for the user relationship.
     */
    'users' => [
        /*
         * User model class.
         * Use this to set the user model class for the user relationship.
         */
        'model' => 'App\Models\User',

        /*
         * User tables foreign key name.
         * Use this to set the foreign key name for the user relationship.
         */
        'foreign_key' => 'user_id',
    ],
];
```

:::warning Note

If you want to change the configuration, you can publish the configuration file in **[the installation step](/laravel-like/getting-started/installation#configuration).**

And if you have already run the migration, **you need rollback the migration and _run it again to apply the changes_**.

```shell
php artisan migrate:rollback
```
:::

If you have rolled back the migration, please handle follow to the modification instructions below to customize it to suit your project.

## Change the table name

You can change the table name for interaction records by updating the `table_name` key in the configuration file.

```php
'table_name' => 'interactions',
```

So now, the interactions table will be named `interactions`.

## Use UUIDs for interactions

If you want to use UUIDs instead of auto-incrementing integers for your interactions table, set the `is_uuids` key to `true`.

```php
'is_uuids' => true,
```

## Change the user model

Sometimes, you may want to use a different user model for the interactions. 

Maybe you are using a **modular structure**, or using **another pattern like DDD(Domain-Driven Design)**. That's why you can change the user model class in the configuration file. You can **skip this step** if you are using the default Laravel user model.

Now, update the `model` key in the `users` array to set the user model class.

```php
'user' => [
    'model' => \App\Modules\User\CustomUser::class, // Custom the user model class
],
```

:::info Explanation
- `\App\Modules\User\CustomUser::class` is the custom user model class.
- You can replace `CustomUser` with your custom user model class.
:::

## Change the foreign key

If you are using a different foreign key for the user relationship, you can update the `foreign_key` key in the `users` array.

```php
'user' => [
    'foreign_key' => 'customer_id', // Custom foreign key name for the user relationship
],
```

:::info Explanation
- `customer_id` is the custom foreign key name for the user relationship.
:::

## Re-run the migration

After you have made the changes to the configuration file, you need to re-run the migration to apply the changes.

```shell
php artisan migrate
```

That's it! You have successfully configured the Laravel Like package. ðŸŽ‰
